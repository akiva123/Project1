# Project1
This project collects data from wikipedia about highest gross profiting and most award winning movies.  It determines what percentage of various movie genres has been used, the movie financial summary statistics over time, the count and frequency of the words in the movie descriptions, and conducts a correlation test to determine whether a relationship between the amount of awards a movie has won and its gross profit is apparent.
